Architecture
============

System components and their interactions
----------------------------------------

A CLIP OS system is split into several logically separated entities:

  * A **bootloader** and an **initial EFI binary** responsible for the system
    start-up.
  * A **Core** responsible for system service hosting and sub environments
    (called *Cages* from now on) start-up. The *Core* is also responsible for
    the isolation and control of all interactions between those *Cages*.
  * One or several **Cages** usually available as graphical sessions for users.
    Each *Cage* may host applications and documents from a specific
    confidentiality level.

   High level overview of CLIP OS components

The execution environment of each Cage is logically isolated from the Core and
from the all other Cages. Interactions between a Cage and the Core is carefully
controlled and goes through confined and unprivileged services as shown in
:numref:`clipos-cage-and-service-isolation`.

   Communication channels between a Cage, the Core and the hardware

Direct communication between Cages is forbidden. All inter-Cage interaction is
mediated by services running in the Core.
