Submitting patches and code review
----------------------------------

We use `Gerrit <https://www.gerritcodereview.com>`_ to review changes for the
project. You may submit patches at `review.clip-os.org
<https://review.clip-os.org>`_ (see Gerrit's `User Guide
<https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.1/intro-user.html>`_
if you are new to Gerrit).

   A GitHub account is required to log into this Gerrit instance.

.. note::
   In order to push commits for review, you need to use an `HTTP password
   randomly generated by Gerrit
   <https://review.clip-os.org/settings/#HTTPCredentials>`_. Please note that
   you can not use your GitHub credentials to push changes to
   `review.clip-os.org <https://review.clip-os.org>`_. Git access is only
   provided over HTTPS (i.e. no SSH).

   You should use ``https://review.clip-os.org/clipos/manifest`` as the manifest URL for
   ``repo init`` (see `toolkit environment setup
   <https://docs.clip-os.org/toolkit/setup.html#how-to-fetch-the-entire-source-tree>`_).

   You may also init the master branch as follows:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      $ repo start master --all

Low difficulty issues
---------------------

We have tagged some issues with the `good first issue` label to help you
identify low difficulty tasks for first time contributors to the project. You
may find them in the `bugs repository
<https://github.com/clipos/bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_.

Continuous integration
----------------------

We use `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>`_ to automatically build
CLIP OS and the projects composing it. The GitLab CI configuration is available
in the `CI repository <https://github.com/clipos/ci>`_, the build status can be
tracked on `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/CLIPOS/ci/pipelines>`_ and the build
artifacts for each pipeline are available at `files.clip-os.org
<https://files.clip-os.org>`_.

Discussion space
----------------

Discussions about the project should happen on our `Discourse
<https://www.discourse.org/>`_ instance at `discuss.clip-os.org
<https://discuss.clip-os.org/c/clipos5>`_. Please ask questions there and feel
free to submit ideas. You may log in with your GitHub account.

Please contact us before committing time on an issue or a change to make sure
we will be able to integrate it once completed.

If you have specific questions, you may also send a mail to `clipos@ssi.gouv.fr
